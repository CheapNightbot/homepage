### TL;DR

- **Linux guest with Windows host**:
  1. Go to "System" tab in the guest VM setting.
  2. Click on "Acceleration". Toggle the "Expert" mode for newer versions of VirtualBox if neccesary.
  3. Select the "Hyper-V" for the "Paravirtualization Interface".

- **Windows guest with Windows host**:
  1. Go to "Audio" tab. Toggle the "Expert" mode if neccesary.
  2. Select "Windows DirectSound" for the "Host Audio Driver" option.
